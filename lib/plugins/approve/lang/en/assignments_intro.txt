====== Approve Assignments ======

Here you can define pages/namespaces where approve is used and specify their approvers.
More precise rule obscures more general.

  * Namespaces excluding subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:*</nowiki>''.
  * Namespaces including subnamespaces are assigned as ''<nowiki>namespace:**</nowiki>''.
  * Pages as usual with their full page ID.

Groups can be assigned as approvers with @ prefix.
